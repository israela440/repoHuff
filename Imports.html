                The fouder of The Birb Beans while not born in Coatepec, grew up in the magic town, now you might
                wondering, what's a magic town? Well in Veracruz, the state Coatepec is in, magic town or more know as
                "Pueblos Magicos" are tourist destination marked out by the state. Coatepec is one of the best destinations
                for a vacation due to not only its ideal geographic location and beautiful weather, but more than anything
                the coffee. In the parks vendors will set up shop and sell coffee related products that we praomise are cheaper
                than the ones we sell. Not only that but the quality of the coffee is ten times better there than if it was to travel
                all the way to your home. So please come on down to Coatepec, Veracruz to enjoy a nice warm cup of coffee when you
                wake up.
